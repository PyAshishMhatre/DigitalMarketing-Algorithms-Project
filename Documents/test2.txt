 Music Yes guys, I was going on welcome back to the channel and to today's video and yep, it's that time of year again. It is the Unicloat, you spring summer 20, 23 drop. I have picked out a few things from the drop, some of my favorite pieces to kind of showcase and style in today's video but on top of that I'm also going to add on some of my favorite pickups that I've kind of accumulated over the past one to two months. So yeah guys, we've got loads to get through but before that I do have to say that the new drop from my clothing brand Studio, this is literally just gone live. It's the first link as always, the first link in the description. It's a full re-sock across all the heavyweight, mild grade pieces plus. We may also have the addition of something new. So we have the oversized heavyweight hoodie, the oversized heavyweight sweatshirt, the oversized heavyweight zipped hoodie, which I will talk about in showcase a little bit later in today's video. And also the heavyweight cuffed joggers, all four pieces restocked, worldwide shipping first link down below. As always guys, everything is completely custom made from start to finish here in the UK, even the luxury fabrics are completely custom-milled here as well. They do tend to sell out pretty fast. So I would advise if you do want something, if you know you want something, pause the video, go down below, hit that link, go and cop whatever it is that you want to buy, but make sure you come back and watch the rest of this video. Let's not make this video a full. Be out guys, enough rambling, let's jump in and take a look at my uniclonew, spring summer 2023 pickups. And then we'll take a look at my monthly favourites. Alright, so I have of course had to include this season's trend coat in today's video for me. Uniclonew trend coat are always on point and to be honest, this one's no different. So it's the oversized single-breasted trend coat in the gray color way, size medium, and this is coming in at 130 pound. I genuinely believe that trend coats are a timeless wardrobe essential. Like no matter the time of year, you know that you can pull off a trend coat. What I like about this one is the color. I'm just imagining this style in a monochromatic way, all the grey tones, you already know it would be a vibe. But yeah, honestly, I really love this one. The color's perfect, the fit is perfect. And I also really like, I'm not sure if the camera's gonna pick it up. But I also really like these two kind of statement pockets that it has on the front. So yeah, honestly, dress it up, dress it down either way, you know you're gonna get a bang off it. Okay team, so next up, we have the Uniclonew short jacket in the black color way. The size large, this is coming in at 70 pound, and honestly right off the bat. What I love about this piece is the fit. That kind of crop in the body for me is honestly what stands out most. And, you know, if you know me, you know I love a good crop body fit. And yeah, this has that in abundance. In terms of the actual fabric, it's kind of like a heavy canvas cotton, but it doesn't actually have any lining on the inside. So it would make for the perfect layer in piece when the day you start getting, when the day you start to get a little bit warmer in the spring months. Like I'm actually about to head to Milan tomorrow, the day after I'm filming this, and I believe the temperatures are kind of sitting around 10 to 14 degrees. And for me, this is gonna be the perfect layer in piece. So obviously guys, you know, make sure you follow me over on Instagram to keep up with the daily Milan fit picks. Alright guys, so moving on next, we have a piece that might actually be my favourite one to come out of the entire Uniclonew spring summer, 2023 collection. And that is the parachute wide leg pants. As you can see, I got these in the gray color way, a size medium, and I believe these are coming in at around 50 pounds. Now these are honestly such a versatile pair of pants. They're a wide cut. So it can be styled with that wide look throughout the leg, where the pants are sit perfectly on top of your footwear. But on the flip side of that, you know, you can also have more of a, I guess, cinched look by tying the bottom up, which I feel gives off a little bit more of a kind of street wear aesthetic. Honestly, I think both ways look great. And like I said, it just kind of adds, you know, to the overall versatility of the pants. So guys, those were my favourite pickups from the latest Uniclonew spring summer, 2023 collection. Now we're gonna kind of move on and showcase just my general favourite pickups over the past month or so. Obviously, there's only one place we can start, and that is my brand new zip hoodie from my brand studio, and like I said before, this is available right now. Another camera isn't gonna pick it up because I'm too close, but it is a two way zipper. So you can kind of, yeah, you'll see it on the on-body stuff, but you can zip the bottom part up, just to kind of show that layering of the t-shirt underneath. But yeah, this is available right now, as well as, you know, the restock on the oversized or crop sweatshirt, the oversized or cropped hoodie, and the cuffed joggers as well. As always, guys, both the quality and the fit of these pieces are incredible. If you've, you know, purchased something from studio to your before, then you'll, you'll know just how good the quality of these are, they're incredibly heavyweight. And yeah, I'm just super excited to kind of add the zipper version to the rotation or to the collection. So just some kind of little details, luxury heavyweight 500 GSM cotton. It is completely a pre shrunk as always, so you don't have to worry about the garment shrinking in the wash. It's got that top stitch finish throughout the entire piece, and then last but of course not least, the metal YKK 2-way zipper. And honestly, having that kind of two-way function, it's just a great way to elevate your overall look. It's a great way to kind of see that layering underneath. So in terms of the actual price guys, zipper hoodies are 120 pound, pull over hoodies 110 pound, and then the sweatshirt and the joggers are both 100 pound and as always, they are available for worldwide shipping. But yeah guys, honestly, just a huge thank you for all the incredible support that you always show. Yeah, it literally, it blows my mind, a big thank you. You're all, you're all a bunch of legends. Let's just, let's leave it at that. The next step is this beauty. This is the Zara Double-Faced Walljacket. I know you lot are going to absolutely love it. I got a size medium, and this is coming in at, I believe, 119 pound. The fit of it is honestly just perfect. It's a great springed layer in piece, and some of you young, keen eyed people up there may think, I'm sure Nathan's already got that in black. Well, yeah, I do, I love it, and that's why I got it in this color as well. That kind of boxy, you know, silhouette is great, and I also really like the exaggerated pockets that it has on the front as well. It just adds a really nice overall kind of statement to the jacket. Next guys, I actually actually picked this up yesterday, and this is the crew neck knit a jumper. This is from ARKIT. I got this in the kind of dark gray color way. Price wise, it is coming in. I think this was 69 pound. Although the, you know, I guess the full winter season has kind of come into an end, I've been wanting to really up my knitwear game, and as soon as I tried this on, I knew I had to get it. I love the color, like team in this, so if you know, with some black trousers, we're looking sane, but also having it as like an under layer to maybe, you know, my trench coat, that will look insanely good as well. I think kind of having that extra texture of the knit layer underneath the trench coat, rather than just like a standard basic white t-shirt, having that extra texture, in my opinion, is a great way, and an easy way to kind of elevate the styling of a trench coat. Alright, so moving on to footwear, my first favorite footwear pick-up has to be the black Adidas sandals. Now, I'm not going to kind of blab on for too long about these, because I literally made an entire video unboxing and styling these, like, I don't know, like a week ago, so I link that in the description down below if you have yet to see it. But yeah, honestly, these are the perfect spring, summer shoe. I've been really enjoying styling them. I'm best believe you're going to see some Milan outfit picks styling these over the next week or so, over on Instagram. Be a guys, I'm not going to talk anymore about these because let's face it. I already have in my previous video. Let's move on. Okay, so the last footwear piece is these loafers, but guys, I need your help. I think I'm pretty sure I'm going to keep them. I'm like 95% sure, but I need your help. I need you to let me know in the comments down below. What you think about these? Do I keep them? Do I take them back? I, like I said, I'm definitely leaning towards keeping them. But yeah, I've been really wanting to join the loafer gang, but I've just, I've been struggling to kind of find a pair that I feel like suits me. But I think this might be that pair. So these are from Zara, the coming in at 80 pound, which I think is a really good price for a pair of genuine leather loafers. And what I like about them is their kind of overall shape. When it comes to loafers, what I have personally found is a load of the ones that I've tried, like very narrow and very pointy at the end. I think that's what I don't like about them. I think that's what I've been struggling with, where these don't have that kind of pointy end, and they are a little bit, they're not chunky at all, but they're slightly chunkier than the kind of narrow pointy ones. So yeah, honestly, I personally think these are a keeper, but I guess they'll be for let me know what you guys think in the comments down below. Next up, we have what is actually the only t-shirt pick up in today's video, and this is the ski t-shirt from the brand Summit UK, and this is actually coming in at 65 pound. Now I've been on the hunt for some more kind of graphic style high quality t-shirts for a while now, and this fits that bill perfectly. It's a really nice heavyweight 300 GSM jersey cotton, and then just the kind of overall details in the design is perfect. As you can see, the front is kind of relatively minimal, but then the design on the back is incredible. Literally, literally looks like some kind of watercolor painting. I'm a big fan. So moving on to accessories, and we have this absolute banger of a bag from the bro Stevie Salle, which was in collaboration with me. I believe this was the round three collaboration between Stevie Salle and Article and Goods. Let's just appreciate how beautiful the brown color of this bag is. So it has a full leather outer with a cotton canvas lining on the inside, but what I actually love most about this is how kind of versatile is when it comes to style and you can style it multiple different ways. It has the long leather strap here, which I guess kind of allows you to style this as more of a cross body bag. And then obviously it goes without saying the quality is impeccable. Like I said before, genuine leather, it's got the metal, white cake, a zippers, metal hardware, and yeah, just a really solid high quality cross body bag. And there we have the guys. So that was 10 of my favorite recent pickups. We have some beautiful pieces from the latest Uniclo U Spring Summer 2023 collection. We also obviously had the beautiful dual zip, two-way zip hoodie from my brand Studio Dizure that is literally just dropped. It is the first link in the description. A big thank you for all the support. If you do copy anything, make sure you're the enemy just so I can kind of personally thank you. But yeah, that's it for this one guys. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope it wasn't a little bit too same Z obviously we've been doing a lot of pickups. I'm literally waiting to move to Manchester like ASAP. So as soon as that happens over the next couple of months, the content, the videos are going to be so much better. So yeah, just stand by. Don't go anywhere. There's some incredible videos to come. But yeah, I'll see you guys next week. Peace. you
