 Yo, what is good everybody and thank you so much for stopping by the channel. For today's video we're gonna be taking a look at the latest release from Uniclo or more specifically Uniclo you spring summer 2023. Now if you're not familiar with Uniclo you line specifically. This is a subdivision of Uniclo that prioritizes the intention of becoming the future of life where essentials. Utilizing some of the most talented designers and pattern makers over in Paris. The Uniclo Uniclo Uniclo has been so well received and without further ado it's going to jump right into what I ended up purchasing putting it on the body ensuring with you guys my opinions starting things off with the Uniclo you knitted polo. This piece is comprised of a ribbed knit 100% con. What's really great about it is it does feature a great level of breathability for optimal flow and comfort. In addition to that you also have the elements of being pretty relaxed throughout while remaining boxy. So this item is very very complimentary to pretty much anybody regardless of where you fall on the spectrum of height. I did end up pairing the knit hoodie with the new regular fit denim. This pair does fit true to size on with the size 30 and they fit great. I would say that the in-seem is great for those of you who have a shorter stature namely due to the fact that I think they do finish at a length of a 30. So if you do have longer legs take that into consideration I do find this denim to be a total bargain at that price point of 5990 the denim is on the lighter side but it does feature a very particular wash. Almost reminiscent of a pair of vintage Levi's 501 if I were to give it a score at a 10. I have to give the denim like a 9.5 out of 10 it is really that good and high value as for the knit polo. At that price point of 3990 also a pretty high value piece very comfortable. I love the silhouette for that reason I'm going to give it an 8.5 out of 10. All right now switching out the polo for the new Sear Sucker Striped Short Slingsher this piece fits E Normus. I ended up going all the way down to a size extra extra small so I would definitely say consider sizing down on this piece because even at an extra extra small and it does fit oversized for reference I'm approximately 57 and weigh 160 pounds with sizing out of the way and dialed in I definitely consider this piece to really really nice. Come spring summer as this is a spring summer 2020 through release. These are the kind of shirts that you just want in your wardrobe. So at that price point of 3990 I say go for this piece and we're ready to want to 10. I give it a 7 just because the sizing is a little bit confusing. Next up we have the Uniclo You Crew Neck Short Slip T-shirt price at 1990 I would say the t-shirts are very very nice. I actually own so many of these crew neck t-shirts. They're very thick comprised of a pretty solid weight cotton. What I love about Uniclo is that they offer a miried of different textures, fabric, garment weights and of course colors and fits with regard to their basic t-shirts. This is definitely one of my staples in my wardrobe. Just easy to go to. You know it's gonna fit exactly how you want it. All of my Uniclo t-shirts have been very, very durable in the wash so that's definitely something. A worth mentioning at a price point of 1990 Uniclo remains to be my favorite go-to place for a simple t-shirt. I highly recommend these t-shirts. I give this one a 10 and a 10. Essentially perfect because I don't know it just doesn't get any better than Uniclo. All right and so moving on to the next outfit this one does feature the oversized workshop. The color that I did opt for is beige. Size into a size extra extra small. This one is comprised of a fairly thin cotton. For optimal breathability and of course because it is oversized once again you do have the extra level of flowiness and the ability to keep a little cooler during those hotter months this summer. I paired that with the Navy salvaged denim and you guys I really cannot say enough good things about the denim over. Knicklo I couldn't ask for a pair of denim fit any better. At the price point of 59 90 I don't get it. I don't understand the economics. How can they make denim this good while making a profit? It's just wild to me. But I won't ask any questions. I would just receive. Needless to say these are a 10 out of 10. I love how they fit. Just another home run from Uniclo. Now as for the top I will say I'm not exactly the biggest fan. This is just for me personally. I just feel like proportionally it just doesn't suit my body. I don't know what it is about this piece. It just feels a little bit on the cheaper side. Almost looking a little cheaper as well. So for those reasons I give this piece a 6.5 out of 10. Next I saw off of the top and put on the short jacket in natural. At that price point in 7990 a really nice piece. I did opt for a size medium which is my true to size size. What's nice is that it is crop as mentioned in the name short jacket. But overall this jacket is just excellent. Light weight. You have a little bit of extra room. If you do intend on layering. Yet again we have another effortless timeless style of garment from Uniclo. This one's an 8.5 out of 10 for me. Spring summer Uniclo you. I definitely had to bring in an aresum tea. This one is of the oversized if you're not familiar with these aresum teas they are just so awesome. This fabric feels something of thicker version of Nike dry fit. This fabric just feels so excellent during those very very hot days. I really lean into the shirts heavily during the summer time. I live in Southern California if you guys don't know and it gets as hot as like a hundred degrees. It is holistically hot in the summer over here. Even though these teasers are extremely elevated versions of basic teasers the price at $19.90. I did opt for a size medium highly recommend these shirts. Go ahead check out your local Uniclo for me. I give this one an 11 out of 10. They're that good. Next we have the wide fit pleated sheenow shorts. I did go ahead and take a size small in this piece which is my true to size size. Now I do have to be honest with you while as you can see on this screen this pair is not exactly complimentary to my shorter stature. I have nothing but very positive marks for this piece. I think for the right person this could look very very nice. Details on this garment are just excellent. I love the pleats out front. I actually also love the way that it's cut and just overall the quality and details of these shorts are very very nice. Price at $49.90 given all the details and how it feels and looks. I do consider this to be a pretty solid pair of shorts at that price point. I do think you should give these a look. If you can rock the oversized shorts look and make it look good unlike myself then I would recommend. I give these shorts an 8 out of 10. And last up for this haul we've got my favorite item from this release. And that is the wide fit pleated jersey pants. I absolutely love these pants. They are so, so good. I love how they fit. I love the condom. They feel amazing on the body. And what's really nice is that they look even better in person than they do on camera or on the picture on the website. What you get from this pant is what looks like faded black. They called it dark gray. Or this pair of pants you can dress them up but for me I do intend on dressing them down this summer and at 59.90 these get a 12 out of 10 from me. And so that's going to do it for my Uniclo haul for spring summer 2023.
